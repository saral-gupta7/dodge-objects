**A simple game to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript foundations**

This project is a **simple browser game** where the player must dodge falling objects. It is designed to help **students build strong foundations in front-end web development**.

- **Purpose of the game**
  - **HTML**: Understand how to structure a web page using elements like `div`, `canvas`, buttons, and text.
  - **CSS**: Learn how to style the page and game area (colors, layouts, fonts, animations, and responsive design).
  - **JavaScript**: Practice adding behavior and logic (movement, collision detection, scoring, game loop, keyboard events).

- **What students will learn**
  - **HTML basics**: tags, attributes, semantic structure.
  - **CSS fundamentals**: selectors, classes/ids, positioning, sizing, and styling the game elements.
  - **Core JavaScript concepts**:
    - Variables, functions, and events (like key presses).
    - Updating the page dynamically with the DOM or canvas.
    - Simple game logic (speed, difficulty, scores, win/lose conditions).

- **How to use this project in class**
  - Start from a working version of the game and walk through the **HTML layout**.
  - Show how changing **CSS rules** affects the look and feel.
  - Explore the **JavaScript file** to see how the player moves, how objects fall, and how the game decides if the player was hit.
  - Encourage students to make small changes:
    - Change colors and fonts.
    - Adjust speed or number of falling objects.
    - Add new rules or effects.

This game is meant as a **hands-on, beginner-friendly project** that makes learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript more fun and interactive.
